    <p>In the heart of Rwanda’s misty mountains, an extraordinary tradition unites conservation, culture, and community: the annual <em>Kwita Izina</em> ceremony, where baby gorillas are officially named. Modeled on age-old Rwandan naming customs, this event has become a symbol of Rwanda’s world-renowned conservation strategy.</p>

    <p>What began in 2005 has grown into an internationally celebrated occasion, attracting conservationists, celebrities, and travelers alike. With every name given, Rwanda strengthens its commitment to monitoring and protecting its most iconic inhabitants—mountain gorillas.</p>

    <h2>Cultural Meaning, Global Impact</h2>
    <p>Each name carries meaning—drawn from Rwandan values, the gorilla’s behavior, or conservation achievements. The ceremony is more than symbolic; it supports real-world tracking and management of gorilla families, which has helped increase the population steadily over the years.</p>
